== Description ==
Grail+ is a set of command line tools for manipulating non-determistic 
finite automata (NFAs), non-deterministic pushdown automata (PDAs), 
and context-free grammars (CFGs). Grail+ is built on top of the Formal
Language Template Library (FLTL), a library for representing and
symbolically manipulating CFGs, NFAs, and PDAs.
